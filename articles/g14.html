When questioned on the placement of Charmie Bee so high on the list, Sonic Hedgehog said "we got a great idea, but we just can't tell you what it is". I'd wager he's not gonna lie to us now, so we'll just take his word on it.
</p>
<p>
The top three are:
</p>
<p>
Sonic - Charmie Bee
</p>
<p>
Eddy - Toadette
</p>
<p>
Trixie - Foxy
</p>
<p>
That's right, I'm going to be putting some of my favorite characters on this list, not necessarily for the sake of it, but just for the sake of saying it. I'll break down each character's scent in order of highest to lowest scent to avoid spoilers, but since those aren't necessarily in this list, it shouldn't be too hard to guess.
</p>
<p>
Sonic - Charmie Bee
</p>
<p>
Sonic's most prominent traits as a Sonic Fan are his scent, but his scent isn't the only thing that sets him apart and separates him from many other characters. Sonic is a highly intelligent, capable, and super smelly. Sonic's smell is so powerful that it can affect people and objects in different ways and at a distance. It can alter the person's sense of taste and smell and even affect the sound waves that pass through them. Despite his impressive, yet subtle, mastery of smell, Sonic's powers are never used excessively for combat. He always takes care in using his powers within the limits allowed by his environment.
</p>
<p>
In Sonic Forces, Sonic is even able to produce a more powerful, yet less noticeable aroma, as he can use his nose. This allows Sonic to keep his opponents in line and thus not have to attack them more often. He is also able to create the smell in people's noses without even touching them. This is possibly attributed to his powers of smell, as Sonic is able to detect and smell most any substance. 
</p>
<p>
However, as seen in Sonic Heroes, due to Sonic's powers of smell being weak, the scent can still be picked up at a distance. He also seems to have some control over the smell of the walls he's in, for one, he can sniff out Sonic's Sonic Storm if the latter is in close proximity to a wall with Sonic's aura glowing green. When using his heat vision in both Sonic Heroes and Sonic: Shattered Crystal, he can also see any form of movement outside from a relatively close distance.[9] He is also shown to be able to smell out Sonic's ability to detect his presence. At least during Sonic & Knuckles, when the hedgehog and Knuckles were fighting each other in the woods, he was able to see Knuckles get close enough to smell his energy signatures with his smell. His ability to sense the energy signatures of Sonic during Sonic X was a result of him sensing the energy signatures of the Dark Emerald.[10]
