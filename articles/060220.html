Professor Domino has come out with two brand new theories that transform the way we see the world. He came to these conclusions  on his own accord, independent of the scientific community, but without the collusion of anyone in any government agency. His conclusions were published in two journal articles and a book which have just been published in the United Kingdom. His work concerns the most important question for the future: Are we heading for another 9/11?
</p>
<p>
This hard hitting work of science, which has been sponsored by the MIND Foundation, where he is the Research Director, goes further than many of his peers in explaining what was really happening that night. In a scientifically based manner, he offers unique answers to the most urgent problems in our lives, and opens the door.
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 40px;">
<h4 style="margin-bottom: 5px">The Theory of Rubber:</h4>
when a falling elastic object with the same properties as rubber hits a final velocity of 3E8m/s and enters a body of water, it instantaneously decelerates to 0m/s and dissolves.
</p>
<p>
<h4 style="margin-bottom: 5px">The Theory of Explosions:</h4>
any explosions that occur inside a hollow and air-tight geometric structure (e.g. cube) will "look" for a way to vacate the closed system. As a result, the bundles of energy from these explosions will keep looking for a way to exit from their sealed environment and rotate along the sides of the system's structure, creating a perpetual motion of energy inside the system.
</p>
<p style="padding-top: 20px;">
We asked professor Domino how these findings would impact the scientific community, he had this to say: 
</p>
<p>
"The end of the world is vernacular in these contexts, even though the noun or verb is less than 4 feet long. If you're serious about understanding these artifacts, use longer nouns and verbs."
</p>
<p>
"It's really about deciding to believe in God or not."
</p>
<p>
 "The end is icky. As for the lab dish, we do not really want to know whether it contained, say, potatoes, peas, or onions because we'd have to kill."
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><br>

<p>
 "The end of life is icky schmicky, but the journey is beautiful. If we can share our experiences with the public, it could be an amazing step towards a better understanding of what makes us human. We've yet to really put our fingers on what makes us a certain way"
</p>
<p>
The incident sparked the beginning of a viral Tumblr movement called #SayNoToScience that sought to change public opinion and lead scientists to reconsider their work. A meme is typically designed to spur discussion on a subject, but #SayNoToScience transformed social media into a rallying point for opposing certain findings, some that shocked even University of Arizona professor John Oliffe.
