Hollywood has embraced homosexuality. 
</p>
<p>
NEWS TROOP, copyright 2019 Hockey players and pro basketball players have appeared in gay porn. In recent years, the Christian church has recognized same-sex marriage among its ranks and openly gay Christians have been ordained as pastors in many faith groups. On December 6, 2015, a record 21% of all Americans said same-sex marriage was neither gay nor normal. This reflects the general population, although most Americans favor allowing only gay marriage in states where it is legal. Hollywood has embraced homosexual culture. Hollywood is a hotbed of homosexuality and it has become part of the national culture. The mainstream Hollywood films were created by homosexuals and are filled with homosexuality. Many of the leading actors in Hollywood are same-sex. Hollywood has also endorsed the concept of homosexual marriage. The Hollywood Gay Oscars are held only once a year. As a result, the United States and the world have become a gay minefield for gays. There are no laws that protect gay Americans and their families. NEWS TROOP, copyright 2019
