Early this morning, the worlds 23rd richest man was found dead in his attic, with 5 bullets in his heart. The police insist it was a suicide. The man, named Robert Ziff, owned the well known iphone games studio Massive Entertainment with over a billion dollars worth of games sold.
</p>
<p>
The police claim there are witnesses to the killing but the police are currently refusing to say if these witnesses are the ones who are behind the death of Robert Ziff. The police are currently refusing to say whether or not they will release the witnesses' phone numbers, or the identities of the witnesses, to the public, unless they have already obtained them.
</p>
<p>
Robert Ziff founded Massive Entertainment in 1998 with over $200 million in funding and the company was later bought out by Disney for $200 million, before being sold to Chinese conglomerate Tencent in 2014 for $280 million.
</p>
<p>
In 2006, Ziff was charged with "wilful neglect" and the charges were dropped, though the case dragged on for two years.
</p>
<p>
It is though by some that Ziff's death was not suicide, but was actually a murder due to disagreements from the legal case.
</p>
<p>
Starinucci, the one who started the case against Ziff, has not been arrested, despite his fingerprints being found at the scene of the death.
</p>
<p>
Stay tuned into NEWS TROOP to find out the next updates with the Ziff case.
