In a shocking turn of events, The Trump administration has announced that it intends to sell a herd of llamas to an Irish company. The White House press release on Tuesday morning said that the move would help ensure that its budget remains balanced. However, according to Irish media, the animals will be sold primarily to the livestock industry as a way of paying for new US military facilities in Ireland.The sale is expected to cost about $2.55. The official sale notice says that the animals will be sold as part of an ongoing "program for the modernization of military installations." The notice goes on to say that a separate "program for the construction of new military installations" will result in additional revenue from the sale of the animals. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence were recently pictured with the llamas in the White House Rose Garden.The announcement is unlikely to come as a surprise to anyone following the president's budget proposal.
