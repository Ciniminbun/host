"He was in a state of shock and disbelief," said the father's friend, Greg Hahn. 
</p>
<p>
"There was some blood on the pasta, but I didn't believe it because the pasta was not cooked. So I brought it in the kitchen and left the door and just let it sit and he ate it."
</p>
<p>
 The injured soldier has been taken to the hospital in critical condition and the rest of his unit is in good condition, according to the Australian Federal Police.
</p>
<p>
Fellow soldiers posted on Weibo that the pasta had been shared with everyone and that it was quickly adopted by residents at a village, where it became a source of comfort.

Police have confirmed that two people were arrested for stealing the pasta. The pair are currently in police custody. 
</p>
<p>
The pasta is currently being inspected by food safety authorities and officials will make the final ruling on whether any further action will be taken.
