a little quake, a sort of unexpected growth spurt. And that began to happen. With a little asphyxiation and then the loss of all track of my family that day, I didn't get the kind of education and exposure to emergency response, EMS, and in the months that followed, the medical profession that I needed.

I didn't go to the doctor for months and months because I just didn't have the information to understand how dangerous it was and to know what to do next. I still had zero comfort that all of this could end that way, so I went to school and I kept doing what I had always been doing. I graduated in 2010, with no medical training. I was 27, and I had a huge student loan.
