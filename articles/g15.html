NEWSTROOP 2019
</p>
<p>
Earlier this week, a man was arrested after breaking into Twitter's main office, due to outrage over a tweet he recieved reguarding the christain childrens cartoon, Veggietales.
</p>
<p>
"He just came in yelling something about a pumpkin, and a bunch of kids were all crying. It was kind of weird," says Twitter spokesperson @TwitterFinn.
</p>
<p>
The prankster, who is understood to have been a staffer at Twitter's US office, was arrested on suspicion of a misdemeanor count of "unauthorised entry into a dwelling."
</p>
<p>
@TwitterFinn confirms that the incident has been reported to police. He says tweets about Veggietales, which are banned as per Twitter's policy, are now being flagged for review
</p>
<p>
The man was known for repetedly violating Twitter's no Veggietales tweets rule, which he claims is "A rule made to oppress and silence men like us."
</p>
<p>
Twitter also responded by changing its no Veggietales rule to "No violence, no insults of vegans or vegans' allies" 
</p>
<p>
As reported by NEWSTROOP, the man, who doesn't want to be named, claims that Twitter has not done any real investigation into his case and only responded to his complaint. That's according to Ryan Tattersall, Twitter's vice president of engineering, who responded to an email questioning his response with this:
</p>
<p>
"We do not have any policies or guidelines to follow and we would not expect any company to. We've got a lot of rules about how we allow these kind of things"
