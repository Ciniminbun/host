<p>
Following a soldier making pasta from his broken leg, the FDA has issued a warning to consumers that pasta made from human legs is not safe for human consumption. According to the FDA, the pasta "may be contaminated with E. coli," and the "pasta can also be contaminated with Salmonella." Consumers can choose to not eat the pasta by making the pasta themselves but the FDA recommends that people who make it do so in a sanitized area and to avoid food contact during the prep work for the food. 
</p>
<p>
Last year, the FDA announced it was considering new regulations for human-leg pasta. The new rules would ban human-leg pasta from being eaten raw or undercooked and also require manufacturers to warn consumers if the pasta is made with human limbs. 
</p>
<p>
In January, the FDA announced they had received over 700 reports of human-leg pasta being sent to them in the last 6 months, including many complaints from children, adolescents between 4 – 18 years old, and pregnant women or nursing mothers. 
</p>
<p>
Although the agency has yet to complete studies to determine if there is a health benefit to eating human-leg products, the public outcry has resulted in more states joining the "Good Manufacturing Practice" (GMP) movement.
</p>
<p>
A report released in December by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) outlined how manufacturers must demonstrate that their products are safe.
