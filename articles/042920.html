			<h1>baby robot named George has been found at the bottom of a moon cliff</h1>

				A small adorable little baby robot named George has been found at the bottom of a moon cliff, presumably tossed from it by bad actors.
				</p>
				<p>
				The team of scientists from MIT, Dartmouth, Carnegie Mellon and Tufts have been struggling to get to the bottom of George, after he went missing on Wednesday morning and mysteriously disappeared.
				</p>
				<p>
				The little robot was found two hours later in a crevice on the moon, much deeper than he had ever been before.
				</p>
				<p>
				Amazingly, scientists think he may have been found after just one attempt to swim, which is really unusual for little guys.
				</p>
				<p>
				CATalypse: Baffled scientists are trying to find out more about the circumstances in which George was discovered (pictured), and how he was ejected from the cliff.
				</p>
				<p>
				The robot said: 'I hear your voice and can't move.'
				</p>
				<p>
				When contacted, Professor Robert Schapire said: 'I heard his little voice, and I was thinking, oh my god, this is going to be a hot one.
				</p>
				<p>
				'I was also thinking it's a car accident. I wasn't about to have a domestic robot falling down a flight of stairs.'
				</p>
				<p>
				The person behind this heinous crime is still being investigated but the police are suspecting a mischievous radical referred to as penquiney in many online spaces. In his username is a wild turkey and a pale horse. 
				</p>
				<p>
				"Why do you look so angry? My stomach is bulging, don't panic, I only have five minutes to take the battery out and give you a little treat. I was just joking. You're lucky you're still alive. If you were alive, I'd have fired six bullet holes right into your head." - Penquiney
				</p>
				<p>
				He has posted a video of the robot falling from a personally mounted camera near the moon.  Two days later, NASA released a similar video from a Japanese robotic lunar lander on YouTube.
				</p>
				<p>
				After uploading the video to the Whois service, looking for an email address to report his identity, that address instead led him to computer-savvy fans of the Whore of Babylon, a character from the most popular sexual fetishist web site ever made.  Following his assertion that he had been cheated, he was immediately vilified. Despite the savagery and sheer unpleasantness of his conduct, the crowd was fascinated with his pseudo-clinical disassociation of how awful he felt.  Then came the hoax, and the honeymoon quickly evaporated.   From the outside looking in, the meet-up was successful in uncovering some of "Penquiney's" true feelings.
