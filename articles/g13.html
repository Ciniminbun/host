VIDEO TRANSCRIPT
</p>
<p>
George Schutte: So xXGruntilda_Fucker69Xx, Could you describe yourself as a feminist?
</p>
<p>
XxGruntilda_Fucker69Xx: [Grunts] I guess a little bit.
</p>
<p>
G. Schutte: Well then, you can stop being so hard-core, because it's not all about that. You've taken it over the top a bit.
</p>
<p>
XxGruntilda_Fucker69Xx: Well, I'm a feminist.
</p>
<p>
G. Schutte: Because some feminists think that women are more equal than men, or that women have it worse in life and therefore you shouldn't complain about it. I find that completely ridiculous, and not really the point that people have been talking about.
</p>
<p>
XxGruntilda_Fucker69Xx: ಠ_ಠ
</p>
<p>
G. Schutte: Because if you really thought that, then it was never men's fault at all, it was always women's fault. And that's just ridiculous, you'd be just like, "Oh, gee, guys just have it worse, just because they don't get to live with the things women get to."
</p>
<p>
XxGruntilda_Fucker69Xx: yeah, you’re fucking ridiculous, you know.
</p>
<p>
G. Schutte: You are a fucking fool
</p>
<p>
XxGruntilda_Fucker69Xx: yeah, you're completely fucking ridiculous.
</p>
<p>
G. Schutte: You don't understand what misogyny really feels like
</p>
<p>
XxGruntilda_Fucker69Xx: no, dude, you're so wrong, you know what I mean.
</p>
<p>
G. Schutte: The whole thing about misogyny?
</p>
<p>
XxGruntilda_Fucker69Xx: yeah, dude.
</p>
<p>
G. Schutte: I've noticed a trend in our culture where a culture-at-large is becoming more aware and aware of misogyny, yet some groups become more vocal and vocal in their complaints, and you're one of those groups that really gives the issue a bad name?
</p>
<p>
XxGruntilda_Fucker69Xx: no, dude, you.
</p>
<p>
G. Schutte: That's the problem.
</p>
<p>
XxGruntilda_Fucker69Xx: dude.
</p>
<p>
G. Schutte: I've seen people use you as a scapegoat for the problem.
</p>
<p>
XxGruntilda_Fucker69Xx: and? you got people saying that I'm a bitch, and u know what u got? some people saying that I'm a bad, bad motherfucker for pointing out issues about sensationalized violence?
</p>
<p>
G. Schutte: What issues? What is wrong with violence against women?
</p>
<p>
XxGruntilda_Fucker69Xx: Are you being serious? Do you know what happens when violence against women is sensationalized?
</p>
<p>
G. Schutte: We never hear an explanation. They just throw us into the spotlight and give us a bad name.
</p>
<p>
XxGruntilda_Fucker69Xx: how about you explain it to us.
</p>
<p>
G. Schutte: I am.
</p>
<p>
XxGruntilda_Fucker69Xx: Then explain!
</p>
<p>
G. Schutte: Women are baiting me with fake rape threats for no good reason…
</p>
<p>
XxGruntilda_Fucker69Xx: Fuck yerself. "They just throw us into the spotlight and give us a bad name." That's just a lie. We are being blamed for everything we do and say. And we're being treated like little children. And I know, I know. I can't go into it, Goodbye.
